The Configuration questionnaire is a excel based document that is made up of several tabs, related to specific information that is needed during the initiation phase of the project. This information will allow your Medius project team to configure the system and start with deployment of integrations.

**Overview:** This specifies the scope. Please confirm that the scope highlighted as “Yes” is correct as this will impact the remaining tabs.
**APA Proc. & Data:** This is information related to how you as an organisation process invoices.
**Azure AD:** More information on the user import alternatives can be found in the following section: xxx.
**D365FO Related Processes & Data:** Data related to masterdata and integration configuration.
**D365FO Technical details:** Data required to start the D365 F&O integration activities. 

The final two tabs relating to D365 are considered the most critical in order to meet initial project timelines and should be completed as a priority.
